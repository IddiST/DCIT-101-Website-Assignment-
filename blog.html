		<small>Posted by Iddris Saeed Tipagya</small>

		<p>Kakum conservation Area(KCA), comprising the
          Kakum National Park and
          Assin Attandanso Resource Reserve, is one
          of the 16 protected areas
          established, and being managed by the
          Wildlife Division of the Forestry
          Commission of Ghana.
          The two protected areas are gazetted
          by Legislative Instrument 1525, 1991. <abbr title="Kakum Conservation Area">KCA</abbr>
          covers an area of 360 km? (36000 hectares) and lie between longitudes 10
          30' and 10 51 W and latitudes 50 20' and
          50 40'N found in the Twifo Hemang
          Lower Denkyira and Assin South
          districts in the Central Region of Ghana.
          The conservation area is surrounded
          by 52 settlements and hamlets with a
          population of about 100,000 and located
          within the Twifo Hemang, Assin
          Attandanso, Assin Apimanim, Effutakwa
          Denkyira and Abura traditional areas.</p>

		<h3>Protected Area</h3>
	<p>
		Protected areas (PAs) are clearly
defined geographical space, recognized,
dedicated and managed, through legal
and other effective means, to achieve the
long term conservation of nature,
associated ecosystem services and
cultural values.
Forest protected areas help conserve
ecosystems that provide habitat, shelter,
food, raw material, genetic materials, a barrier against disasters, and many other
ecosystem goods and services and thus
can have important role in helping
species, people and countries adapt to
climate change.

		<h3>Tropical Rain Forest</h3>
		<p>It is a representative sample of fast
           disappearing tropical rainforests and
           serve as habitat for forest species of
           global conservation concern such as forest elephants, colobus monkeys, long
           snouted and dwarf crocodiles, and
           Hypolycaena kakumi (a butterfly species
           first discovery to science in <abbr title="Kakum Conservation Area">(KCA)</abbr>among
           others. KCA being well drained serves as
           the watershed for major streams such as
           Kakum, Obuo and Afia which provide
           drinking water for people in the Cape
           Coast Metropolis, Twifo Hemang Lower
           Denkyira and Assin South districts.
           The KCA provides a unique
           microclimate suitable for agriculture
           and as a result it is surrounded by a
           mosaic of farms such as oil palm, cocoa
           and rubber plantations. Being an
           ecotourism destination, CA receives
           over one hundred thousand tourists
           annually making it the most subscribed
           protected area in Ghana.</p>

		<h3>Number of Challenges</h3>
		<p>
			In spite of its importance, KCA faces a
            number of challenges such as hunting of
             wildlife including wholly protected
            species, illegal logging, farm
            encroachments and fringe land
            conversion for food and cash crops.
            Moreover, with KCA lacking buffer zones
            around the park and thus sharing boundary with farms, the level of
            elephant crop raiding on fringe farm
            sources is pronounced. This often leads
            to various levels of human wildlife
            conflicts that negatively affects
            livelihood security of fringe
            communities and impact on the PA's
            conservation efforts

           A time series historical perspective of Kakum
           Conservation Area 1925 - 1926 Kakum Forest
           Reserve covering an area of 213.48 km2 was
           selected and demarcated by the
           Gold Coast Gazette. The Governor in
           Council at the time, constituted the
           demarcated area into a forest reserve, under
           section 4(4) of the Forest Ordinance, Cap 63.
           The reserve was necessary to protect
            the forest against destruction since it
           acts as a safeguard for the water supply
           of the region and the climatic conditions
           necessary for productive agriculture
